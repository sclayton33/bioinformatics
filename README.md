# bioinformatics
Code and resources for bioinformatics practice that I've done.

# RNA-seq
My main focus for now since I will need the pipeline for that in the immediate future.

# Proteomics
A lower priority, but still need to learn.

# Whole Exome Seq
May need to learn this sooner than proteomics, not sure.
